# Digital_Assistant
A voice controlled digital assistant


This works best on a Raspberry Pi (Raspbian OS). You'll have to modify the code a bit to make it work on Linux systems such as Ubuntu.
Would not recommend use on Windows (though if you wish, you will have to make changes to the code)

#Required software
SQLite3
PyAudio
Alsa
Speech Recognition module of Python
Wikipedia module of Python

#Hardware
Microphone (I also used a USB sound card to connect the mic to the Pi)
LED (If on Pi, this is to indicate when the Pi is listening for input)
